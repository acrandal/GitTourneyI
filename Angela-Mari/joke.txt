A dog walks into a telegraph office.
He asks the telegraph operator to send the message:
"Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof"

The telegraph operator says "That's only 9 words which costs the same as sending 10. 
Do you want me to add an extra woof?"

The dog replies "What? No. That wouldn't make any sense."
